GitHub: used to share and collaborate projects. a website used to share an entire repository with people

command: git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain to enable password autofill in bash in the future

syncing repositories:
syncing doesnt happen automatically
to allow syncing data onto GitHub, it uses a concept of a remote repository not 'git clone', github doesnt allow direct recloning onto their servers. So we have to create an empty repository in a known location on github. To allow syncing data bewteen two repositories git has a concept of a remote repository which lets you store the location of the repository that you want to send and receive data from, what you sent and receive are commits. To sync with the remote repo, one can 'push' or 'pull' a branch/commit.

command: 'git remote' (To view and create remotes).
command: 'git remote add <name> <url>' (to add a repository as a remote)
command: 'git remote -v' (to verify the remote repo has been added. v stands for verbose meaning git remote will output more info)
command: 'git push <remote branch> <local branch>' (takes 2 arguements the remote to send changes to, and name of local repo which we'd like to push)
